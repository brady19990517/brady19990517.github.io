How To: Enable Spark Dynamic Allocation (CDH, Kyligence)

Description: 
The Resource unit of spark is called an executor. In yarn, the num-executor
attributes specify how many exectors can Spark has, while executor-memory and executor-cores
limit the memory and virtual CPU cores each executor consumes. For example, if user choosed
"Fixed Resource Allocation" and set num-executor as 3, then there will be 4 YARN containers,
1 for application master and 3 for Spark executors. These 4 containers will keep the resource
occupied even if no process is running and the resource will only be released when the user
log out. Enabling "Dynamic Allocation", Spark will dynamically increase and decrease the executors
numbers according to query engine which save the resources.

Solution:
1. Copy yarn-shuffle.jar under $KYLIN_HOME/spark/yarn to $HADOOP_HOME/lib of all hadoop
nodes in cluster, where $HADOOP_HOME is "/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-..../lib/hadoop" for cloudera.
2. Copy the below snippet into NodeManager Advanced Configuration Snippet(Safety Valve) for
yarn-site.xml in Yarn configuration
