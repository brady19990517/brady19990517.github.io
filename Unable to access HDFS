Problem: Unable to access HDFS in Hadoop standalone mode

Description:
  "$ sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -ls /" keeps giving me local directory instead of HDFS, 
  and this Warning "Warning: fs.defaultFS is not set when running "ls" command." appears
  when inputing above command.
 
Path to Solution:
  The warning read "fs.defaultFS is not set", so I first have to know what fs.defaultFS is.
  After digging through the internet, I found out that "fs.defaultFS" is a property inside
  "core-site.xml" called "fs.default.name", where "fs" means "file system" and "default.name" means
  "namenode", and the value of this property is the ip address of the name node.
  This property serves two functionalities:
    1. Makes HDFS a file abstraction and set a abstract root directory for HDFS, so that HDFS does 
    not share the same directory with local system.
    2. Gives the datanodes the address of namenode, datanode look at this property for the address of
    namenode and connect to it.

Solution 1:
  Ignore the warning, which means leave "fs.defaultFS" unset. However, now when you want to access
  HDFS, you have to specify the ip address of the namenode.
  Example: "sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -ls hdfs://10.192.181.139/"
  
Solution 2:
