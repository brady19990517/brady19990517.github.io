Problem: Both HBase's master and region server failed to start (Partially Solved might have a better way)

Description:
  In cloudera manager both HBase master and region server failed to start, and both of their
  health test are bad.
 
Path to Solution: (Optional)
  Look into HBase log, found out the master server is down because of RetriesExhaustedException
  where region server cannot be started, so first check why region server cannot be started. Found
  out the region server cannot be started becuase of "NotServingRegionException: hbase:namespace,,
  1562646733636.222a2eb43f6320f8f9ed5ab2ed9fd140. is not online on ubuntu", which means for some 
  reason this namespace table cannot be started. This error might happen because of some unsynced 
  communication between HBase and Zookeeper. After some digging, I found out the only way that
  works for me is to delete the files and directory under /hbase in HDFS and delete the znode
  /hbase in zookeeper. I know this is a bad idea since all the tables and data inside HBase is gone,
   but I have no better way currently.

Solution:
  1. Stop HBase service in CM
  2. Delete files under /Hbase in HDFS by "sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -rm /HBase/*"
  3. Delete /hbase znode in zookeeper by "zookeeper-client" and "rmr /hbase"
  4. Restart Hbase service
