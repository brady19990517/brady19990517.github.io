Path to Solution: (Jump to the solution if you dont care how I got the anwser)
  Look into HBase log, found out the master server is down because of RetriesExhaustedException
  where region server cannot be started, so first check why region server cannot be started. Found
  out the region server cannot be started becuase of "NotServingRegionException: hbase:namespace,,
  1562646733636.222a2eb43f6320f8f9ed5ab2ed9fd140. is not online on ubuntu", 

Solution:
  Permission Error
  Change the owner of the file by
  "sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -chown worker /user/worker"
